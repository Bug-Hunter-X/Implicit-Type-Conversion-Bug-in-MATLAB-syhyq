# Implicit Type Conversion Bug in MATLAB
This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in MATLAB related to implicit type conversion.  MATLAB's flexibility in handling different data types can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not handled carefully.  The example shows how a seemingly straightforward function can produce incorrect outputs due to implicit type conversions.

## Bug Description
The `myFunction` MATLAB function uses conditional statements to perform different calculations based on the input value. When the input is a string that can be implicitly converted to a number, MATLAB performs this conversion and executes the comparison and calculation as if it were a number. This behavior might not always be desired and can lead to unexpected results. The example showcases that providing a numeric and string input which can be converted to a number results in different outcomes that may not be expected.

## Solution
The solution provides explicit type checking and conversion, to ensure consistent and predictable function behavior regardless of the input type.
